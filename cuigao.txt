Dear Editor,

Sorry for disturbing you. 
I am not sure if it is the right time to contact you to inquire about the status of my submitted manuscript titled ¡°The association between HBV DNA level and Mother-to-child Transmission in a Chinese population: a nested case-control study and meta-analysis¡±(ID: SREP-16-39935). As the status of "Manuscript Submitted" has been lasting for more than about two months since submitted to journal, I would be greatly appreciated if you could spend some of your time check the status for us. I am very pleased to hear from you on the reviewer's comments. 
Thank you very much for your consideration. 
Best regards! 
 
Yours sincerely, 
Taiwu Wang
